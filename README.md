# xyz-reader
This is my repository for project 5 of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program in which I applied the principles of material design in remaking a two-screen news-reader app. See below for before and after screenshots.
Features include: app bar and collapsing toolbar layouts; floating action buttons; appropriate fonts, metrics, and color themes; full bleed images.
